# BUGS to FOPPL transpiler

[BUGS](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs) (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) is a flexible software for the Bayesian analysis of statistical models using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

FOPPL (First Order Probabilistic Programming Language) is a stripped down version of [Anglican](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/anglican).

The ANLTRv4 specification of BUGS grammar was obtained heavily inspired with the FLEX+BISON lexing and parsing grammar incorporated in [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/) 4.3.0 [source code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/4.x/Source/), in files `src/lib/compiler/parser.yy` and `src/lib/compiler/scanner.ll`.
